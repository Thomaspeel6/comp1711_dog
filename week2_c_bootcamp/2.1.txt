gcc, is used to compile the code. 
gcc 'name of file' -o "file_name"


to run it:
./"file_name"

use # to find libraries for teh code, for example for printf use 
#include<stdio.h>


use % as a way of telling computer to lookat the integer
%d 
%u 

scanf doesnt want to know the variable just wants to know where it is stored. the pointer 
for scanning a string %s
double- means real number instead of int
and %f and not %d
